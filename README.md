# blender-python-experiments

Some experiments in trying to create 3D images, in particular graphs and diagrams, using Python and Blender command line.

Some parts of this code are copied from https://github.com/yuki-koyama/blender-cli-rendering. That repo is worth looking at as it has more material than I have included here.

This probably won't be maintained long-term, if I manage to get a workable system I will most likely add it to the generativepy project. But if anything here is useful to anyone, feel free to make use of it. It is licensed under GNU GPL, because that is the licence used by the blender-cli-rendering library that I used as a starting point.
