# blender-python-experiments

Some experiments in trying to create 3D images, in particular graphs and diagrams, using Python and Blender command line.

This probably won't be maintained long-term, if I manage to get a workable system I will most likely add it to the generativepy project. But if anything here is useful to anyone, feel free to make use of it (MIT licence).
